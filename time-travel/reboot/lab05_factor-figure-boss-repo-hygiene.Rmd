# Lab 05: Factor and figure management; Repo hygiene {#lab-05}

```{r include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

<!--Original file: hw05_factor-figure-boss-repo-hygiene.md-->

## Overview

Goals:

* Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
* Write some data to file and bring it back into R.
* Remake at least one previously made figure (or make a completely new figure), using new knowledge, such as ability to control the color scheme, empowerment about factor levels, better figure making mechanics, or visualization design principles.
* Write a figure to file explicitly and include it your R Markdown report via `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)`.

Remember the [sampler concept][wiki-sampler]. Your homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for canonical tasks. Make things nice -- your future self will thank you!


## Gapminder data ... or something else

You can work with the Gapminder data or take this chance to play with something else. In which case, you'll have to create comparable tasks for yourself.

The Gapminder data is distributed as an [R package on CRAN][gapminder-cran].

Install `gapminder` if you have not done so already and remember to load it.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
```

## Factor management

__Drop Oceania.__ Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the `continent` of Oceania.  Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.


__Reorder the levels of `country` or `continent`.__ Use the `forcats` package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median. While you're here, practice writing to file and reading back in (see next section).

Characterize the (derived) data before and after your factor re-leveling.

  * Explore the effects of `arrange()`. Does merely arranging the data have any effect on, say, a figure?
  * Explore the effects of reordering a factor and factor reordering coupled with `arrange()`. Especially, what effect does this have on a figure?

These explorations should involve the data, the factor levels, and some figures.

## File I/O

Experiment with one or more of `write_csv()`/`read_csv()` (and/or TSV friends), `saveRDS()`/`readRDS()`, `dput()`/`dget()`. Create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of Gapminder. I highly recommend you fiddle with the factor levels, i.e. make them non-alphabetical (see previous section). Explore whether this survives the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.


## Visualization design

Remake at least one figure, in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color. Maybe juxtapose before and after and reflect on the differences. Use the country or continent color scheme that ships with Gapminder. Consult the guest lecture from Tamara Munzner and [everything here][graphics-overview].


## Writing figures to file

Use `ggsave()` to explicitly write a figure to file. Then use `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)` to embed it in your report. Things to play around with:

* Arguments of `ggsave()`, such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.
* Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.
* Explicit provision of the plot object `p` via `ggsave(..., plot = p)`. Show a situation in which this actually matters.


## But I want to do more!

Make a deeper exploration of the `forcats` packages, i.e. try more of the factor level reordering functions.
  
Revalue a factor:

  * Pick a handful of countries, each of which you can associate with a stereotypical food (or any other non-controversial thing ... sport? hobby? type of music, art or dance? animal? landscape feature?). Create an excerpt of the Gapminder data, filtered to just these countries. Create a new factor (you pick the name!) by mapping the existing country factor levels to the new levels.
    - __Examples:__ Italy --> wine, Germany --> beer, Japan --> sake. (Austria, Germany) --> German, (Mexico, Spain) --> Spanish, (Portugal, Brazil) --> Portuguese. Let your creativity flourish.
    

## Report your process

You're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. Give credit to your sources, whether it's a blog post, a fellow learner, an online tutorial, etc.


## Assess your work

The [general rubric](#lab-rubric) applies, but also...

__Check minus:__ One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. Itâ€™s hard to figure out where to look for what in this doc.

__Check:__ Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No heroic detective work required. Well done! *This should be the most typical mark!*

__Check plus:__ Exceeded the requirements in number of dimensions. Developed novel tasks that were indeed interesting and "worked". Impressive use of R -- maybe involving functions, packages or workflows that weren't given in bookdown materials. Impeccable organization of repo and report. You learned something new from reviewing their work and you're eager to incorporate it into your work.
