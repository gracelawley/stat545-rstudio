# Week 2A Overview

* Please take this survey (yes of course it's a Shiny app!):
  - <http://shiny.stat.ubc.ca/STAT545/stat545-basic-info/>
  - this is how we get your GitHub username, match you against the course list, and give you a private course repository within the [STAT 545 Organization](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC)
  - username and password for survey given in class
* Quick live look at "who's in here?" (see below)
* Revisit toy line script from last class, which covered:
  - [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html)
  - Do "Compile Notebook" on it!
* Work on "Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio" and "Early GitHub Usage" from  <http://happygitwithr.com>
  - If you see slides, they'll be something like these:  <https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user>
  - Goal: [New project, GitHub first](http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)
* What's coming?
  - DATA!!
  - Exploring the Gapminder data
  - `data.frame`
  - `ggplot2`
* First homework will be due midnight Tuesday September 20, but preferably before class. Go to office hours if struggling! See the [2015 version here](hw01_edit-README.html) (some changes still coming).
