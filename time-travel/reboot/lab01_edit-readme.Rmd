# Lab 01: Edit `README.md` and Use R Markdown {#lab-01}

```{r include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

<!--Original file: hw01_edit-README.md-->

<!--GL: The original STAT545 course instructors/TAs would create private repos for each student and have them stash their homeworks there. What if adapted this and had the learner create a personal repo in this homework/lab? This would make it easier to adapt the later homeworks, and then we could still keep most of the original homework 01.-->
